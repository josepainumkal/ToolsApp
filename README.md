## Hands-on experience with tabbed interfaces## 
* Built a tabbed interface having 2 tabs â€“ a BMI calculator and a simple day finder utility.
* BMI Calculator: Takes height and weight attributes from the user. Calculates the BMI index and tells in which category user falls (8 categories to determine Overweight, Under Weight or Healthy)
* Day finder Utility: User enters the date. Spinners are used for choosing the day, month and year. The utility app tells which day, the entered date is.
